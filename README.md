SAFe-BLID: MATLAB Implementation
Self-Attentive Federated Bi-LSTM Intrusion Detection Framework
Overview

This repository contains a full MATLAB (R2015a+) implementation of SAFe-BLID, a cloud-based intrusion detection system (IDS) designed for IoT environments.
The framework integrates:

Enhanced Multi-Objective Genetic Feature Selection (EMOGFS)

Hierarchical Self-Attention Bi-LSTM deep classifier (HSA-BiLSTM)

Cloud-based scalable inference layer

The project includes complete modules for preprocessing, feature selection, classification, evaluation, dataset handling, and simulation of IoT devices.

Features

✔ Synthetic datasets resembling UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017, KDDCup99
✔ Data preprocessing & normalization
✔ EMOGFS genetic feature selector (tournament selection, adaptive mutation, elitism)
✔ HSA-BiLSTM classifier with hierarchical attention
✔ Cloud simulation for inference timing
✔ Full evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, FPR)
✔ Reproducible MATLAB code (2015a compatible)
